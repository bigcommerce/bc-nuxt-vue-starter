## Requirements

You'll need a BigCommerce store and a token for our GraphQL Storefront API, which you can create in the API Account section of the control panel.

If you're new to BigCommerce, that's ok! You can create a free developer sandbox store here: https://developer.bigcommerce.com/sandbox/vue

## Props

Divante's awesome open sourced Storefront UI project made it possible to quickly make this look and feel like a real e-comm site using Vue + Nuxt. Check it our here: http://storefrontui.com/
